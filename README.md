Course "IBM Data Science", Capstone Project, April 2020 by [Markus MÃ¤chler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-maechler/)

## Jupyter Notebook

The code can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/Funisher-code/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/notebook/POC_food_delivery_recommender_system.ipynb), but it's best viewed [with jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Funisher-code/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/notebook/POC_food_delivery_recommender_system.ipynb), because GitHub doesn't render Folium maps natively.
